# Advent of Code 2020 in Rust

## Goals
- Gotta go fast â€” prefer stack over heap, iterators over loops, etc.
- Somewhat idiomatic rust
- Hopefully no dependencies
- Occasional macro autism
- Learn something new

## Non-goals
- Ridiculously-optimized algorithms
- Overly-verbose real-world-ish types

## Things learned so far
- Would be really cool to have [streaming iterators][1], [std::io::Lines][2] is nice but it allocates a new string for each line
- One can accidentally create [a recursive macro][3] that seems to perform better than [itertools' alternative][4]
- [Slice patterns][5] were a thing all this time
